This repository offers the codes for generating the examples in our paper titled "A flexible PageRank-based graph embedding framework closely 
related to spectral eigenvector embeddings".
The graph embeddings folder hosts the codes for all the experiments on graphs. The various graphs used in the paper can be generated by running 
diff_graphs.jl and the "log PR" graph in the introduction can be obtained by running introduction.jl
Similarly, all the codes in this folder are self explanatory.
For the hypergraph emebddings, we offer the codes for contact-primary-school dataset and the yelp dataset. The necessary data is hosted at the
references mentioned in the paper. After obtaining the data, the file read_data.jl should be run first which will produce the .mat file. This file 
is used by smalltest.jl to produce the pictures in the paper.
